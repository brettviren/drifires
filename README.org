#+title: drifires - a drift/field responses calculator 

* Overview

~drifiers~ calculates drift paths and field responses on electrodes as
induced current.  The heavy lifting is done by Garfield++.  ~libdrifers~
provides support for LAr and parameterized models for geometries
related to typical LArTPC detectors.  The ~drifiers~ command line
interface produces diagnostic output and response data suitable for
use with Wire-Cell Toolkit.
